            8/21-24/23 Week 1 <br>
            Today is Thursday. I had Living Earth and AP Hug today. <br>
            After school today I have practice for MTB. This week was pretty <br>
            easy. I also took some funny pictures of the group. We had an  <br>
            experiment with the half pipes and marbles, we did pretty bad but  <br>
            it was pretty fun. I look forward to more in the future. <br>

        Week 2 : 8/27-31/23 <br>
        Today is Thursday again. I had my same classes and they were pretty <br>
        and easy. In AP Hug today we made our places chart and I did Mammoth <br>
        I again have practice today at 4 and we are going to mainly just do some <br>
        paperwork again. Engineering was ok today. <br>
        </p>

       Week 3 : 9/5-9/8
       Today is yet again Thursday. Our construction of our "roller coaster" <br>
       is going smoothly. My group started working on our stability but not did <br>
       get too far yet. Next class we are planning on finishing our stabilizers <br>
       and starting our top portion that holds the car. We still need to work <br>
       on our idea of the pulley with the string holding the baseball. Joe was <br>
       our materials manager for today and collected the cardboard, our bucket, <br>
       and our hardboard. He let me cut a stabilizer with the box cutter. <br>

       Week 4 : 9/11-9/15
       Today we tested our roller coasters. Ours took a while but we eventually <br>
       fixed it. We just had to increase the force to the needle. We also had to <br>
       extend the needle so it reached the balloon. It took us around 20 tries <br>
       and alot of deleted videos. <br>

       Week 5 : 9/18-9/22 <br>
       Today we worked on our computer engineering worksheet. It was pretty easy <br>
       but I will have to watch some of the video at home. On Monday we tried to <br>
       upload videos. On Tuesday we made paper boats and saw whos could carry <br>
       the most weight. Mine lasted the full 5 mins or so. Today we filled out <br>
       the comp mech worksheet and watched the video. <br>

      week 6 9/25-9/29 <br>
      Week 6. this week we worked on our computer engineering worksheet. <br>
      It was easy and we took the quiz on Thursday. I was absent Thursday <br>
      so I am updating this a week late. It is currently week 7.<br>
      </p>

      Week 7 10/2-10/6 <br>
      Week 7. On Monday we worked on another challenge. This was the hand. <br>
      Damon left early so I had to finish it by myself. I made a very good <br>
      hand. Thursday. TOday we worked on TinkerCad and made a prostethic <br>
      limb. We also did the biomechanical worksheet. <br>
      </p>

      Week 8 10/9-10/13 <br>
      Week 8. Monday. Today we took the bioengineering quiz. It was pretty hard <br>
      I think that I should have studied the careers and organizations a little <br>
      more. Today we are also going to be learning about aerospace engineering. <br>
      I think this will be a fun unit. Thursday. TOday we went on tinkercad and <br>
      created a bottle rocket design. Dominic was absent today so I sat by my-<br>
      self. It was pretty easy. <br>
