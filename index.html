            8/21-24/23 Week 1 <br>
            Today is Thursday. I had Living Earth and AP Hug today. <br>
            After school today I have practice for MTB. This week was pretty <br>
            easy. I also took some funny pictures of the group. We had an  <br>
            experiment with the half pipes and marbles, we did pretty bad but  <br>
            it was pretty fun. I look forward to more in the future. <br>

        Week 2 : 8/27-31/23 <br>
        Today is Thursday again. I had my same classes and they were pretty <br>
        and easy. In AP Hug today we made our places chart and I did Mammoth <br>
        I again have practice today at 4 and we are going to mainly just do some <br>
        paperwork again. Engineering was ok today. <br>
        </p>

       Week 3 : 9/5-9/8
       Today is yet again Thursday. Our construction of our "roller coaster" <br>
       is going smoothly. My group started working on our stability but not did <br>
       get too far yet. Next class we are planning on finishing our stabilizers <br>
       and starting our top portion that holds the car. We still need to work <br>
       on our idea of the pulley with the string holding the baseball. Joe was <br>
       our materials manager for today and collected the cardboard, our bucket, <br>
       and our hardboard. He let me cut a stabilizer with the box cutter. <br>
       </p>

       Week 4 : 9/11-9/15
       Today we tested our roller coasters. Ours took a while but we eventually <br>
       fixed it. We just had to increase the force to the needle. We also had to <br>
       extend the needle so it reached the balloon. It took us around 20 tries <br>
       and alot of deleted videos. <br>
       </p>

       </p>
       Week 5 : 9/18-9/22 <br>
       Today we worked on our computer engineering worksheet. It was pretty easy <br>
       but I will have to watch some of the video at home. On Monday we tried to <br>
       upload videos. On Tuesday we made paper boats and saw whos could carry <br>
       the most weight. Mine lasted the full 5 mins or so. Today we filled out <br>
       the comp mech worksheet and watched the video. <br>

      week 6 9/25-9/29 <br>
      Week 6. this week we worked on our computer engineering worksheet. <br>
      It was easy and we took the quiz on Thursday. I was absent Thursday <br>
      so I am updating this a week late. It is currently week 7.<br>
      </p>

      Week 7 10/2-10/6 <br>
      Week 7. On Monday we worked on another challenge. This was the hand. <br>
      Damon left early so I had to finish it by myself. I made a very good <br>
      hand. Thursday. TOday we worked on TinkerCad and made a prostethic <br>
      limb. We also did the biomechanical worksheet. <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      Week 8 10/9-10/13 <br>
      Week 8. Monday. Today we took the bioengineering quiz. It was pretty hard <br>
      I think that I should have studied the careers and organizations a little <br>
      more. Today we are also going to be learning about aerospace engineering. <br>
      I think this will be a fun unit. Thursday. TOday we went on tinkercad and <br>
      created a bottle rocket design. Dominic was absent today so I sat by my-<br>
      self. It was pretty easy. <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      Week 9 10/16-10/20 <br>
      Week 9. This week we designed, built, and tested our bottle rockets. On Monday <br>
      we designed our rockets. My partner was Dominic. On Tuesday we built our rockets <br>
      Dominic was absent for half the class so I had to take charge. I decided to use br>
      mostly tape and not much hot glue. I was absent on Thursday but Dominic sent me a <br>
      video. <br>
      </p>
      
      </p>
      Week 10 10/23-10/27 <br>
      Week 10. This week we worked on our water filters. I did this with Dominic. Our order <br>
      was cotton ball, pebbles, sand, and rocks. This worked rather well. It was a <br>
      pretty easy challenge but we did not have time to finish filtering the water all the way. <br>
      We learned about environmental engineering this week. It was pretty entertaining. <br>
      </p>
      
      </p>
      Week 11 10/30-11/3 <br>
      Week 11. This week we started electrical engineering. It is pretty understandable <br>
      but still a bit hard. Later in the week we worked on our tinkercad labs. <br>
      I finished the first, second, and third lab pretty easily. I also understood <br>
      the volts and amps worksheet. I finished this pretty easily. Dominic <br>
      helped me with the labs which made it a lot easier. <br>
      </p>

      </p>
      Week 12 11/6-11/10
      Week 12. This week we did the phyiscal lab for electrical engineering. We <br>
      worked on the bread boards. Dominic was my partner. He did a lot of the work <br>
      but I did a reasonable amount as well. The lab overall was pretty easy <br>
      although it took some thinking. <br>
      </p>
      
      </p>
      Week 13 11/13-11/17
      Week 13. This week we did business engineering. It was very understandable. <br>
      We also learned about the trolley problem. On Thursday we did the worksheet. <br>
      we also started the Shark tank thing. We are doing an ice cream cone holder. <br>
      </p>
      
      </p>
      Week 14 11/27-12/1
      Week 14. This week we finished all of our business assignments. I presented <br>
      today (Thursday) but on Tuesday we prepped for the shark tank slides. I think <br>
      that we did rather well. My favorite pitch was probably the college guide <br>
      app becasue I know how hard it is to choose a college. It was a very good <br>
      idea that I think if executed properly it would make a lot of money and be <br>
      very useful. <br>
      </p>
      
      </p>
      S2 Week 1 1/8-1/12 
      Week 1. This week we did chemical engineering. I finsihed the worksheet with <br>
      Dominic and it was pretty easy. I learned a lot. Earlier we did the ooblek <br>
      project and mine turned out great. I learned a lot. One thing I learned <br>
      is that you always have to know the correct amount of a chemical reaction <br>
      </p>
      
      </p>
      S2 Week 2 1/15-1/19
      Week 2. This week we did project propoasals and learned about mousetrap <br>
      cars. I researched a lot. I found some new strategies to make the car go <br>
      as well. From the video I learned about weight and aerodynamics. <br>
      </p>
      
      </p>
      S2 Week 3 1/22-1/26
      Week 3. This week I was absent for every day so I could not get much in <br>
      class work done. Other than that, I reasearched some more and did my <br>
      TinkerCad. This was pretty easy and I figured out my measurements.  My <br>
      first plan for week 4 is to start building the car. <br>
      </p>
      
      </p>
      S2 Week 4 
      </p>
      
      </p>
      S2 week 5 2/5-2/9
      Week 5. This week I havent finsihed my car yet so I will update with my <br>
      problems once I finish and measure. <br>
      </p>
